# FlooringMastery
This is my Java mastery project for the Software Guild Java bootcamp. This was completed after five weeks of Java coursework (before starting web technologies, databases, etc.).

FlooringMastery is a Java console application for creating, reading, editing and deleting orders from a fictitious flooring company. Built with an MVC architecture, the application uses Spring MVC, Maven package management, and full JUnit unit testing. Data is read from and persisted to text files.
